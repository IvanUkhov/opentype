<p>In professional typography, the term <em>typeface</em> is not interchangeable
with the word <em>font</em> (originally “fount” in British English, and
pronounced “font”), historically defined as a given alphabet and its
associated characters in a single size. For example, 8-point Caslon
Italic was one font, and 10-point Caslon Italic was another.
Historically, fonts came in specific sizes determining the size of
characters, and in quantities of sorts or number of each letter
provided. The design of characters in a font took into account all
these factors.</p>

<p>As the range of typeface designs increased and requirements of
publishers broadened over the centuries, fonts of specific weight
(blackness or lightness) and stylistic variants (most commonly
<em>regular</em> or <em>roman</em> as distinct to <em>italic</em>, as well as <em>condensed</em>)
have led to <em>font families</em>, collections of closely related typeface
designs that can include hundreds of styles. A font family is
typically a group of related fonts which vary only in weight,
orientation, width, etc., but not design. For example, Times is a font
family, whereas Times Roman, Times Italic and Times Bold are
individual fonts making up the Times family. Font families typically
include several fonts, though some, such as Helvetica, may consist of
dozens of fonts.</p>

<p>The distinction between font and typeface is that a font designates a
specific member of a type family such as roman, boldface, or italic
type, while typeface designates a consistent visual appearance or
style which can be a “family” or related set of fonts. For example, a
given typeface such as Arial may include roman, bold, and italic
fonts. In the metal type era, a font also meant a specific point size,
but with digital scalable outline fonts this distinction is no longer
valid, as a single font may be scaled to any size.</p>

<p>The first “extended” font families, which included a wide range of
widths and weights in the same general style emerged in the early
1900s, starting with ATF’s Cheltenham (1902—1913), with an initial
design by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, and many additional faces
designed by Morris Fuller Benton. Later examples include Futura,
Lucida, ITC Officina. Some became superfamilies as a result of
revival, such as Linotype Syntax, Linotype Univers; while others have
alternate styling designed as compatible replacements of each other,
such as Compatil, Generis.</p>

<p>Typeface <em>superfamilies</em> began to emerge when foundries began to
include typefaces with significant structural differences, but some
design relationship, under the same general family name. Arguably the
first superfamily was created when Morris Fuller Benton created
Clearface Gothic for ATF in 1910, a sans serif companion to the
existing (serifed) Clearface. The superfamily label does not include
quite different designs given the same family name for what would seem
to be purely marketing, rather than design, considerations: Caslon
Antique, Futura Black and Futura Display are structurally unrelated to
the Caslon and Futura families, respectively, and are generally not
considered part of those families by typographers, despite their
names.</p>

<p>Additional or supplemental glyphs intended to match a main typeface
have been in use for centuries. In some formats they have been
marketed as separate fonts. In the early 1990s, the Adobe Systems type
group introduced the idea of <em>expert set</em> fonts, which had a
standardized set of additional glyphs, including small caps, old style
figures, and additional superior letters, fractions and ligatures not
found in the main fonts for the typeface. Supplemental fonts have also
included alternate letters such as swashes, dingbats, and alternate
character sets, complementing the regular fonts under the same family.
However, with introduction of font formats such as OpenType, those
supplemental glyphs were merged into the main fonts, relying on
specific software capabilities to access the alternate glyphs.</p>

<p>Since Apple’s and Microsoft’s operating systems supported different
character sets in the platform related fonts, some foundries used
expert fonts in a different way. These fonts included the characters
which were missing on either Macintosh or Windows computers, e.g.
fractions, ligatures or some accented glyphs. The goal was to deliver
the whole character set to the customer regardless of which operating
system was used.</p>

<p>The size of typefaces and fonts is traditionally measured in points;
<em>point</em> has been defined differently at different times, but now the
most popular is the Desktop Publishing point of 1/72 in (0.0139 in or
0.35 mm). When specified in typographic sizes (points, kyus), the
height of an <em>em-square</em>, an invisible box which is typically a bit
larger than the distance from the tallest ascender to the lowest
descender, is scaled to equal the specified size. For example, when
setting Helvetica at 12 point, the em square defined in the Helvetica
font is scaled to 12 points or 1/6 in (0.17 in or 4.3 mm). Yet no
particular element of 12-point Helvetica need measure exactly 12
points.</p>

<p>Frequently measurement in non-typographic units (feet, inches, meters)
will be of the <em>cap-height</em>, the height of the capital letters. Font
size is also commonly measured in millimeters (mm) and <em>qs</em> (a quarter
of a millimeter, <em>kyu</em> in romanized Japanese) and inches.</p>
